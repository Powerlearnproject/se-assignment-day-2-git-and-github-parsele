## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
.it allows developers to keep track of changes made to thier code over time.it allows data
## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
.public resipitories are accessible to everyone on the internet while private resipitories are only accessible to you 
                   ADVANTAGES OF PUBLIC RESIPITORY
1.open to every one
2.an ideal for open source projects and collaboration
3.anyone can view ,fork and clone code
                  DISADVANTAGES OF PUBLIC RESIPITORIES
1.Increases the risks of attackers might exploit vulnerabilities
3.anyone can access sensitive informatin
                ADVANTAGES OF PRIVAVE RESIPITORY

.view your changes in Gitlab

commit is saving file that have been edited or changed
## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
BRANCHES allows you to develop features,fix bugs,or safetly experiment with new ideasin a contained area of your resipitory
## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another. 

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
they are mainly used for iterate on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to upstream resipitory ,such as in open source projects or when a user does not open source project or when user does not have write acces to the upstresm resipitory

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.
helps organize and prioritize your work using scrum framework for project management
## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
